    <h2 id="About"> About me </h2>
    <p>
        Hello, my name is Karim. I graduated from high school in the summer of 2021 from BASE. For the first two years of high school, I thought that I was going to pursue engineering in college. However, during my junior year, a computer science class using JavaScript changed my mind. We covered basic concepts like drawing shapes and solving simple problems. It may not have been too complicated, but it sparked my interest in computer science. Later on, I took an AP computer science course (I forgot which one), which solidified my decision to choose computer science as my major for college.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        As of now (7/17/23), I am about to enter my junior year of college. The college has taught me many things so far, and the first and hardest lesson was realizing that I was not fully prepared. My time management skills were poor at the beginning, and the workload took a toll on me. Fortunately, I have since improved my time management and prioritization skills. One thing that has helped me during the dreaded finals week is understanding that whatever happens is up to God, and as long as I do my best, I should leave everything to Him, "for surely He is the best of planners" (Quran 8:30).    </p>

    <h2 id="Experience"> Experience </h2>
    <h3 id="Experience">summer 2020 & 2021</h3>
    <p id ="Experience">In the summer of 2020, I Integrated STEM activities into programs to enrich educational impact and inspire novel career paths. Learned financial literacy and how things like taxes, Roth IRA funds, 401K, investing, and multiple other things would help us financially as young adults. Analyzed and produced a project on mechanisms that play a big role in things like how water is transported from its sources.</p>
    <p id ="Experience">In the summer of 2021, I learned about multiple possible careers and the skills needed for them, learned about front-end careers like web development, learned the basics of HTML, and made a miniature test website to put out knowledge to use.</p>
    <h3 id="Experience">Freshamn year</h3>
    <p id ="Experience">For my first year, I started slow and took an Intro to Python class that covered things like turtles, numPy, matplotlib, and more. This class taught us the basics of Python. In the second semester, I took an Intro to C++ class which covered the basics of classes, strings, arrays, vectors, and recursion.</p>
    <h3 id="Experience">Sophmore year</h3>
    <p id ="Experience">In the first semester of this year, I took discrete structures, which was an extremely challenging class however, it helped teach me how to think more outside the box especially when it comes to concepts that I do not fully understand. In the second half of this year, I took a computer architecture class and continued the C++ track. In the C++ track, we continued to learn and produce projects that have to do with topics like object-oriented programing, inheritance, abstract data types, Big O notation, and pointers, and we also learned about linkedBag, lists, and doubly linked lists, polymorphism, searching and sorting functions, stacks, queue, trees, BST, and a light intro into heaps we did a total of 6 projects which I will be explaining under my projects section. </p>

    <h2 id="Projects"> Projects </h2>
    <h3 id="Projects"> Self</h3>
    <h4 id="Projects"> Portfolio website</h4>
    <p id="Projects">My first individual project would be this portfolio website that I plan on updating as I learn more and more, there were a lot of things that I wanted to do but I was held back by my lack of experience with JS which after this fall's codepath course I should be okay with. For this website I am currently using HTML and CSS to make it, this took me about a couple of days on and off but it is simple hence the fast completion time. I do plan on eventually using JS and adding things to the website to make it look better.</p>

    <h3 id="Projects"> Classes</h3>
    <h4 id="Projects"> 235-1 <br> <a href="https://github.com/Hunter-CSCI235-Spring2023/project1-KarimE146" target="_blank">Project 1</a></h4>
    <p>This project was more of a small task to help clean off the rust. It was just basic OOP and remembering how to use setters and getters. The task was "This is a baseline project whose objective is to get you acquainted with the platforms we will use in this course and to refresh your knowledge of basic OOP. You will implement the Book class. To complete this project" this project was also our first real-time using git and GitHub and understanding version control as well as pulling, pushing, committing etc.</p>
    <h4 id="Projects"> 235-2 <br> <a href="https://github.com/Hunter-CSCI235-Spring2023/project2-KarimE146" target="_blank">Project 2</a></h4>
    <p>This project was built off of the previous one and introduced us to inheritance. We made 3 classes that derived from the original Book class that also had some of their unique functions and uses. Our task was "For Project 2 you will need to build on Project 1 to work with inheritance and separate compilation: after completion of this project you should be comfortable compiling multiple classes into one program, understand #includes and work with basic inheritance.". This was a little challenging but I got it done.</p>
    <h4 id="Projects"> 235-3 <br> <a href="https://github.com/Hunter-CSCI235-Spring2023/project3-KarimE146" target="_blank">Project 3</a></h4>
    <p>This project builds off of the previous 2 but this time introduces us to using templates and ADTs. Using what we know about array bag we "develop a LibraryRecord ADT that will store the Book data type you have been working on in the past projects. The LibraryRecord will store Books much like an ArrayBag. LibraryRecord will be a subclass of ArrayBag which specializes in storing Books.  Imagine you are engineering a system for librarians and you will design the library system through which they access Book information.". We also used operator overloading in this project.</p>
    <h4 id="Projects"> 235-4 <br> <a href="https://github.com/Hunter-CSCI235-Spring2023/project4-KarimE146" target="_blank">Project 4</a></h4>
    <p>Just like the past 3 this built on what we already have, but even thou the past 2 were a bit challenging, this one was especially hard. Our task was "In Project 4 we will use Polymorphism to store (via pointers) different Book-derived objects into an array. We will, thus, be able to display different book data using subclass-specific data members. This project will continue to build on the previous projects and work with the ideas of Polymorphism and Abstract classes. You will work with a dataset. To access the data, you will read the input from a file. See linked resources below.". This was the only project I was not able to get full points. What made this project hard for me is that we had to deal with a data set that I was not fully used to yet. (I also had some technical difficulties during this project so I'll use that as an excuse)
    </p>
    <h4 id="Projects"> 235-5 <br> <a href="https://github.com/Hunter-CSCI235-Spring2023/project-5-KarimE146" target="_blank">Project 5</a></h4>
    <p>Finally no more books, this project taught us how to understand and implement doubly linked lists, sorting functions, and comparators. Even though this project was hard I did find it a little fun because of the trial and error aspect that was in it as well as the topic of the project, our task was "The YGOCard is a class representation of a Yu-Gi-Oh! trading card. Don't worry, you won't need to know how to play the game, all you need to know is that a YGOCard has 7 data members: the name of the card, the type of card, the level (or rank) of the card, the attribute of the card (Wind, Earth, Fire, Water), the race of the monster of the card (Machine, Dragon, Fiend) and finally the attack points (atk) and defense points (def) of the monster. Now to keep this project simple we are only concerned with 3 elements: name, atk, and def. When sorting we will use atk or def as the keys so that we are able to sort the cards by attack value. The DoublyLinkedList class that you've seen in lecture and the Node class that goes along with it. These implement a doubly-linked list data structure. The CardShop class inherits from DoublyLinkedList. The parameterized constructor is similar to the one you implemented in the previous project: it will read from an input file and fill up the shop with pointers to the corresponding YGOCard objects (note that it will store pointers to YGOCard objects, not the object itself). The CardShop class extends DoublyLinkedList with 4 sorting algorithms that you will implement in order to sort all the YGOCard objects by metrics such as atk and def.". This was a little hard to understand and took a lot of youtube videos to understand the various sorting techniques but it was fun never the less.</p>
    <h4 id="Projects"> 235-6 <br> <a href="https://github.com/Hunter-CSCI235-Spring2023/project-6-KarimE146" target="_blank">Project 6</a></h4>
    <p>For our final project(we had 1 more after this but I got all the points I needed and did not want to suffer during finals) we made a Sudoku solver. This project had me on the edge of breaking down constantly and had me contemplating my life choices. Our task was "For this project, you will build the SudokuSolver, which reads a sudoku puzzle from a file and finds a solution if one exists.
        You must implement each function in this class sequentially (implement and test). Only move on to implementing the next function when you are confident the previous one has been thoroughly tested and is correct. Some functions will depend on others, so choose the order of implementation carefully. Use stubs where necessary. Remember that the names of all functions, parameters, and return types must match exactly those in this specification.". After completing this project I felt happiness and satisfaction that I can only imagine is equal to that of someone that finished climbing Mt. Everest, this project took a piece of my soul that I will never get back.</p>
